# clibgame/test

This thing is an application that's effectively just a test for `clibgame`.
It won't necessarily even build with the HEAD version of `clibgame` because it
tends to lag behind.

### Building

Building this project requires CMake version `>= 2.8`.

```
$ cmake .
$ make
$ ./build/bin/clibgame-testing # Running the application.
```
